== Factory Pattern

=== GoF Definition

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

=== Things to note about Factory Pattern

* This pattern caters to creation of objects of specific interface/class, let us call it `Product`
* The term interface is referred as a generic concept that is a contract expressed for the calling code to expect in the `Product`
* Factory or Creator class is used to create the objects of the specific interface
* The concrete implementation which is returned from the `Factory` method is not known to the calling code
